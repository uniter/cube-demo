Uniter Cube demo
================

Getting started
---------------

1. `npm install`
2. `composer install`
3. `npm run build`
4. `Open /index.html` in a browser

Playing around
--------------
The PHP source code is in the `php/src/*` folder - dig in and make changes. Don't forget to rebuild
your JS bundle with `npm run build` when you're done!

Debugging
---------
For a debugging build including source maps, use `npm run debug`.

You should simply see a spinning 3d cube.
